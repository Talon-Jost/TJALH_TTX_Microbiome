# TJALH_TTX_Microbiome
This work is the microbiome analysis and statistical analysis of the collaborative efforts of project designer Alysha Henderson from Washington State University and co-author Talon Jost from Eastern Washington University

This code is open sourced to use, replicate, and modify as neccessary in the efforts to advance science and ensure open access to anyone (scientist or other) who may need it; however, please cite the original authors.

These analyses were performed using various FOSS platforms including, QIIME2-2023.7 (CLI interface), RStudio (R V4.3.1), Pycharm (Python 3.8), VScode (R and Python). All of this code has been checked to be in working conditions to be replicable in future efforts; however, not all of these artifacts/files are able to be used in any version in any time. Please take note of the version which you are using to perform your own analyses and download appropriate legacy versions if necessary to continue without errors.

if you have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to reach out.
