This code is open sourced to use, replicate, and modify as neccessary in the efforts to advance science and ensure open access to anyone (scientist or other) who may need it; however, please cite the original authors.

NOTE: The code and associated results are the product of countless hours of work from numerous different FOSS programs with associated differences in versions. These programs are open to all, but not all versions are able to have files and codes directly inputted to produce the desired results. RStudio (R V.4.3.1), Pycharm (V 2023.2), VScode (V 1.83.1), and QIIME2 (CLI q2-2023.7) were used in the production of these results. Please note you may need to activate different legacy versions of programs and associated programming languages for some aspects to work properly.

if you have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to reach out.
